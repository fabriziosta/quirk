mkdir /root/scripts

- Put QwirkServer from windows to linux vm:
pscp.exe C:\Users\Fabrizio\Desktop\QwirkServer.jar root@192.168.0.50:/root/scripts/

- Create qwirk.sh and write on it:
cat <<-END >/root/scripts/qwirk.sh
#!/bin/bash
java -jar /root/scripts/QwirkServer.jar
END

chmod 777 /root/scripts/qwirk.sh

cat <<-END >/etc/systemd/system/qwirkd.service

systemctl start qwirkd

- Add as a pacemaker resource:
#I've tried many times and many different ways to add qwirkd as a 
#pacemaker resource, but when I execute this command:
pcs resource create Qwirk systemd:heartbeat:qwirkd
#it says: "Error: Unable to create resource 'systemd:heartbeat:qwirkd', 
#it is not installed on this system (use --force to override)"
#I've tried to force it too, but without any success. The service is 
#active and running on the system, for this reason I've decided to 
#manage it through the system and avoiding to give it in pacemaker's 
#hands. Maybe because I don't have a resource agent in #/usr/lib/ocf/resource.d

I am going to enable it for the system:
systemctl enable qwirkd

To read output from the stdout jsut type:
journalctl -u qwirkd
